      <PolicySection title="1. Overview">
        <PolicyParagraph>
          {COMPANY_NAME} facilitates live, real-time negotiation and transactions between Buyers, 
          Sellers, and Service Providers. Because transactions occur over live audio/video calls 
          and often include perishable or custom-made goods and on-demand services, this Returns & 
          Refunds Policy balances Buyer protections under Nigerian law (e.g. Electronic Transactions 
          Act 2023, Federal Competition & Consumer Protection Act 2018) with the operational 
          realities and risk exposures of our Platform.

      <PolicySection title="2. Buyer Cancellation Rights">

            You may cancel any order at any time before the Seller confirms dispatch or service commencement.

        </PolicySubsection>
        <PolicySubsection title="Post-Delivery 'Cooling-Off' Right">
          <PolicyParagraph>
            Under Section 16(3) of the Electronic Transactions Act 2023, you have a seven (7)-day 
            period from delivery or service completion to cancel and request a refund, subject only 
            to return-shipping costs and any agreed service fees.
          </PolicyParagraph>

      </PolicySection>

      <PolicySection title="3. Seller's Live-Negotiation Disclosures">
        <PolicyParagraph>
          Sellers must disclose any non-standard return conditions (e.g., restocking fees, custom 
          order non-returnable clauses) during the live call, before sale confirmation.
        </PolicyParagraph>
        <PolicyParagraph>
          Any such conditions become part of the binding contract only if they do not conflict with 
          your statutory rights under Nigerian law (e.g. cooling-off right).
        </PolicyParagraph>
      </PolicySection>
